  <b>Ayam Goreng Berempah (Spiced Fried Chicken)</b>
  <ol>
    <li>Blend/pound lemongrass, garlic and ginger into a paste. Set aside.</li>
    <li>In a bowl add in chicken, pounded paste and the rest of the ingredients <b>except egg and rice flour.</b> Mix
      everything well. Marinate overnight or at least 4 hours.</li>
    <li>Add egg and rice flour to marinated chicken, coating them well. Set aside.</li>
    <li>Heat a pot of oil on medium heat. Fry chicken until golden brown and fully cooked. Place paper towel to drain
      the
      excess oil.</li>
  </ol>
  <b>Sambal Tumis Ikan Bilis (Anchovies Sambal)</b>
  <ol>
    <li>Blend chilli, shallots, garlic, shrimp paste and ginger with a splash of water ,into a paste. Set aside.
    </li>
    <li>Heat some oil in a pot and fry the anchovies until they are crispy. Place on paper towel, set aside. Then fry
      the onions until they are soft and golden brown at the edges. Place on a plate, set aside.</li>
    <li>Pour in the blended chilli and add in a splash of water to loosen it up a bit. Cook for 15-20 minutes until the
      sauce reduces and thickens (stir now and then).</li>
    <li>Season with salt, sugar and tamarind juice (a good sambal needs to be a bit sweet with a balance of sour and
      salty). Add in fried anchovies and onion. Turn the heat off and mix well. Sambal is ready.</li>
  </ol>
  <b>Nasi Lemak (Rice with Coconut Milk)</b>
  <ol>
    <li>Soak basmati rice with water for 30 minutes. Drain right before using.</li>
    <li>Place the rest of the ingredients in a pot and bring to a boil, then add in rice. Bring it back to a simmer,
      cover pot with a lid and cook on low heat for 20 minutes. Remove from the heat and leave it for another 10 minutes
      before fluffing up the rice and serve.</li>
  </ol>
  <b>Things to note:</b>
  <ol>
    <li>Change the ratio (coconut milk : water) if you prefer the rice to be less buttery.</li>
    <ol>
      <li>For <b>basmati rice</b> 2 cup coconut milk:2 cup water or 1 cup coconut milk:3 cup water.</li>
      <li>For <b>jasmine rice</b> use 2 cup coconut milk:1 cup water or 1 cup coconut milk:2 cup water.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Use any other protein source that you like for sambal (no need to fry first except chicken).</li>

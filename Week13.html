Common Mistakes in Assg 1
- File Naming Linking problems
- No Github repository :(
- Missing out filling in Github pages link in readme. Yes, we have the github link, but
without the github page we can only test it locally. We can download the code.
However, we are looking it to work on a server which is your github pages.
- Github REPO != Github Page They are two different things!
- No Readme or Missing out filling in documentation in the README.md
- Missing out on wireframes in the project
- Poor commits and No Commits into repository
github.com/<user>/<repo> <project repo>.github.io/<username>

Missing out on Github Pages
Having your site live on github pages is part of the scoring rubrics.
Some have not created their Github Pages for the assignment
Some created the Github page but didn’t place any link to it in their README.md
- Missing out filling in Github pages link in readme. Yes, we have the github link, but
without the github page we can only test it locally. We can download the code. However,
we are looking it to work on a server which is your github pages.
- Github REPO != Github Page They are two different things!
(github.com/<user>/<repo>) (<project repo>.github.io/<username>)

Non-Formatting of Readme.
Use proper markdown syntax to format.
https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/
https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf
https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax
What’s wrong?
It’s pretty hard to read the text in the README if its non well-formatted. It’s important to have good and
proper documentation for your project. Treat it as a document you are presenting to people who’s new to
the project. Results in loss of marks.. ;/
Everything comes in one
paragraph, with no
hyperlinks to anywhere
or any line breaks.
Example
Which one should we
click ?

Poor Commit Messages
The Problem: Commit messages that doesn’t tell us much.
For new files, new updates → usually its fixes, enhancements or
improvements. State them down.
Commit messages tell us a lot about the progress on the project.
They should be meaningful sentences that describe about the
project.
Write an imperative tense: “Fix bug”.
[Add |Fix | Remove| Update| Refactor]
Consistent wording makes it easier to mentally process a list of
commits. Never add "-ed" or "-ing" to your message like "Added"
or "Adding". Your verb should start with a capital letter as well.

Poor Commit Messages
The Problem: Not descriptive
Commit messages need to be well written, unambiguous and
descriptive.
Commit messages need to be specific to the exact change made.
Each commits message should be meaningful to avoid repetitive
commit messages.
Advanced: For each features to be implemented, use a separate
branches.

Messy file structure and bad naming convention
Organise your code into proper folders
Images, pictures → images/ or img/
Stylesheets → styles/ or css/
Regarding naming, it doesn’t make much of a difference if we name the
images directory images/ or img/, or the styles directory styles/ or css/, or
the javascript/ directory js/. The main thing is that the structuring is logical,
and we always follow something of a convention, either long descriptive
names, or short ones.
● Use hyphens between words (instead-of-spaces)
● Create Folders. Give the folders clear and concise names
● Avoid special characters (!@#$%*)
● Shorter names are generally better
● Use a name that reflects the file/picture (i.e. "Shutterstock13826048563"
won't be easy to find later

Spaces in files. :(
For web files, it becomes
problematic to link files
with spaces. You might
miss out on how to link it
properly. Creating page
not found errors
A sample structure like this
helps in clearer organisation
of files
No folder structure.
Having uppercase and
lowercase in file names.

Weird Readme This is adapted from
the project brief.
This is the student’s
readme :(
The readme is not to answer the project brief questions/guide.
The Readme is to document the project details for anyone new to the
project.
The project brief guide is just to guide you in how to write a README

Wireframes We are not expecting exact or
super super pretty designs in your
wireframes.
Simple “boxy” layouts like this,
allows us to tell structure, layout.
The higher the detail, may be good.
But also gets to “hope” for it to be
exactly as shown in the wireframe.
Wireframes are not the final design
but an initial concept,design flow of
the application.
